	\section{Overview}
	This project aims to simulate an advanced power system that involves transmission lines, transformers, buses, and other components of a power grid system.

	\section{Classes}
	
	\subsection{Bus}
	This class inserts the busses needed to build circuit. The class is designed such that any amount of busses can be added to the circuit and will be properly classified into PV, PQ, or slack busses
	
	\subsection{Transformer}
	
	\subsection{Transmission Line}
	
	\subsection{Conductor}
	Since the ACSR conductor type is used this class collects all the parameters about the conductors.
	
	\subsection{Bundle}
	Since this circuit will use multiple conductors per phase in the transmission line this class is needed to calculate the parameters per phase
	
	\subsection{Geometry}
	This class calculates how the location of the transmission lines affect certain parameters.
	
	\subsection{Circuit}
	This class acts as the main source of controlling the flow of power throughout the system. It calls other methods and utilizes them to create objects and insert values for power flow analysis.

	\section{Example Problem with Solution}
	\noindent
	Transformer stuff:
	
	\noindent
	Impedance: $Z = V_{sc} / I_{sc}$
	
	\noindent
	$R = P_{sc} / I_{sc}^{2}$
	
	\noindent
	Admittance: $X = \sqrt{Z^{2} - R^{2}}$
